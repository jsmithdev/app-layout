# 📱 app-layout

An app layout for LWC apps consisting of app bar, menu, drawer, etc

Demo: [https://jsmithdev.github.io/app-layout/](https://jsmithdev.github.io/app-layout/)

## 👩‍💻 Development

`npm i` to install dependencies

`npm start` to have webpack serve the app and live reload

`npm run build` or `npm run build:dev` to build to /dist

> During build [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) uses the common (prod or dev) [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js)

## 🚧 WIP

Still building but at some point this may turn into one or more of the following:

- just make the repo a template
- incorporate into my lwc-app yeoman generator
- make importable via npm publish
- break every component out and this be a mono repo

> That's in order of lift therefore probability 😼
